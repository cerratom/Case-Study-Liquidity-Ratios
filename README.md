# Case Study: Using a custom python module to evaluate Apple Inc. liquidity ratio for the last 10 years.

In the following exercise, we will use a custom python module to measure Apple Inc.'s ability to pay its short term obligations. The objectives of this mini-project are:

- To apply the custom python module create in the previous article to real-world data.
- To practice data manipulation with Python using the panda's library.
- To practice visualizing data frames using Python's matplotlib library.
- To automate the creation of a table of liquidity ratios using Python and save it as a Microsoft Excel file.

Please know that this project does not seek the following:

- To teach the basics of Python.
- To be an exhaustive financial analysis of Apple Inc.'s financial statements.

## Task Description

We are assigned the task to automate the creation of a table that contains the liquidity ratios for Apple Inc. for the last 10 years. We also want to visualize the results while comparing them with industry ratios.
